## Welcome
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Louisville. I am working to understand the epoch or reionization by studying very high-redshift Lyman alpha emitters.

I recently completed my Ph.D. working with Dr. Caryl Gronwall at the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics at Pennsylvania State University. I studied star-forming galaxies via their emission lines.  My work spanned a very large redshift range, from the local universe to some of the first galaxies at z = 6. I was also a part of the Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) that will measure changes in the expansion rate of the universe using baryon acoustic oscillations.

I am also interested in science policy and communication. I have written for Astrobites – a website with daily paper summaries for non-experts as well as career advice, general astronomy knowledge, computing, etc. I have also participated in the American Astronomical Society’s Congressional Visits Day, where we spent time speaking with our congresspeople in Washington about the importance of science funding and infrastructure.  I recommend anyone interested in science policy apply to participate in that endeavor.
