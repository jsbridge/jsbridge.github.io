## Welcome
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Louisville](http://www.louisville.edu). I am working to understand the epoch or reionization by studying very high-redshift Lyman alpha emitters.

I recently completed my Ph.D. working with Dr. Caryl Gronwall at the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics at Pennsylvania State University. I studied star-forming galaxies via their emission lines.  My work spanned a very large redshift range, from the local universe to some of the first galaxies at z = 6. I was also a part of the [Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment](http://hetdex.org) (HETDEX) that will measure changes in the expansion rate of the universe using baryon acoustic oscillations.  

I am also interested in science policy and communication. I am currently the content manager of [AstroBetter](http://www.astrobetter.com), a resource for all things related to careers in astronomy. I have written for [Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/) – a website with daily paper summaries for non-experts as well as career advice, general astronomy knowledge, computing, etc. I have also participated in the American Astronomical Society’s [Congressional Visits Day](https://aas.org/posts/blog/2015/01/why-you-should-participate-cvd-advocate-astronomy), where we spent time speaking with our congresspeople in Washington about the importance of science funding and infrastructure.  I recommend anyone interested in science policy apply to participate in that endeavor.
